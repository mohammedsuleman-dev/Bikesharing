# Bike Sharing Linear Regression Assignment

## Synopsis:
This assignment is a programming task focused on constructing a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

## Problem Statement:
A bike-sharing system offers bikes for shared use to individuals for a short-term rental fee or even free in some cases. These systems typically involve automated docks where users provide payment information to unlock a bike, which can later be returned to any dock within the same system.

BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the United States, has experienced a significant decline in revenue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is facing challenges in sustaining its operations in the current market conditions. In response, BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdowns end, and the economy returns to normalcy.

As part of this effort, BoomBikes intends to gauge the demand for shared bikes among the public after the pandemic-induced quarantine measures are lifted nationwide. This initiative is aimed at preparing the company to meet the needs of customers once the situation improves and to distinguish itself from competitors, ultimately leading to substantial profits.

To achieve this, BoomBikes has enlisted the services of a consulting firm to identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes. Specifically, they want to gain insights into the factors that impact the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The company seeks answers to the following questions:

1. Which variables significantly influence the prediction of bike demand?
2. How effectively do these variables explain the variations in bike demand?

To gather relevant data, the service provider has collected an extensive dataset on daily bike demands across the American market, considering various factors, including meteorological data and lifestyle patterns.

## Business Goal:
The primary objective is to construct a predictive model for shared bike demand using the available independent variables. This model will serve as a valuable tool for management to comprehend how demand levels fluctuate with different features. It will enable the company to adjust its business strategy to align with demand and meet customer expectations. Moreover, the model will provide insights into the demand dynamics of a new market, aiding in informed decision-making.
